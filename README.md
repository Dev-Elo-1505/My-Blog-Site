 I want to build a personal blog
 User flow: type in url -> see listed blogs with title, date, author(me), and snippets -> click on post to navigate and view full posts
 My flow: visit /admin -> login -> fill in post details -> publish post -> post appears on homepage

 My Flow: /admin
 1. I need routing to /login that navigates to /admin(private route) using react router
 2. using firebase auth to login but here's the catch only i can login no other dude
